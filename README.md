### About the Experiment 

In previous experiments, we examined the various forms of wear that result from protuberances or asperities at microscopic level on relatively moving surfaces causing friction. So, introducing a material that lessens friction between two moving parts can help extend the component's life by decreasing wear. This material is called a lubricant. Lubricants can be liquid, solid, or plastic substances, and are used based on the component materials and operating conditions. Therefore, lubrication is a means of minimizing wear and friction between moving surfaces in contact through the application of a friction-reducing layer. The introduction of lubricants modifies the contact between moving surfaces and the load they experience based on the thickness of the lubrication film. This experiment will examine different lubrication mechanisms and how they affect material wear.
